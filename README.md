# Codebase Extractor

A simple Python tool to extract and combine code from an entire codebase into a single text file for simplifying workflows when using LLM's.

## Features

- üìÇ **Complete Directory Traversal** - Scans your entire codebase (all directories and subdirectories)
- üö´ **Customizable Exclusions** - Skip specific file types or directories
- üå≥ **Directory Tree Visualization** - See your project structure at a glance
- üìù **Token Counting** - Get a rough estimate of the codebase size in tokens
- üñ•Ô∏è **Console Feedback** - Visual progress indicators during processing
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible Configuration** - Command-line arguments for easy customization
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Extraction** - Prevents recursively indexing previous extraction files
- üìé **Selective Inclusion** - Include only specified files' content while maintaining full structure
- üîÑ **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher

### Option 1: Clone the repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/codebase_extractor.git
cd codebase_extractor

# Optional: Install dependencies for progress bar
pip install tqdm
```

### Option 2: Download the script directly

You can also download just the `codebase_extractor.py` script and run it directly.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python codebase_extractor.py
```

This will extract all files from the current directory (excluding default binary files and system directories) and save them to `codebase_extract.txt`.

### Custom Usage

```bash
python codebase_extractor.py --root /path/to/your/project --output project_extract.txt --exclude "*.log" --exclude "temp/" --force
```

### Selective Content Inclusion

To include only specific files in the content (while still mapping the entire directory structure):

```bash
# Space-separated file list
python codebase_extractor.py --include "main.py utils/helpers.py models/user.py"

# OR comma-separated file list
python codebase_extractor.py --include "main.py,utils/helpers.py,models/user.py"
```

This is particularly useful when preparing extracts for AI tools like Large Language Models (LLMs) where you want to:
- Give the AI the complete project structure for context
- Only include the specific files that are relevant to your current task
- Reduce token usage by omitting irrelevant file contents

### Command-line Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--root` | `-r` | Root directory to start extraction (default: current directory) |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output file name (default: codebase_extract.txt) |
| `--exclude` | `-e` | Exclude patterns (can be used multiple times) |
| `--include` | `-i` | Only include content for specific files (space or comma separated) |
| `--no-defaults` | | Don't use default exclusions |
| `--no-progress` | | Don't show progress bar |
| `--force` | `-f` | Force overwrite if output file exists (skips confirmation prompt) |

### Exclude Patterns

You can exclude files and directories using patterns:

- `*.ext` - Exclude all files with the extension `.ext`
- `dir_name/` - Exclude directory named `dir_name`
- `filename` - Exclude files named `filename`

### Include Patterns

You can specify which files to include in several ways:

- `filename.ext` - Just the filename (will match in any directory)
- `dir/filename.ext` - Relative path from the root directory
- `*.py` - Wildcard pattern to include all Python files
- `models/*.py` - Wildcard pattern to include Python files in a specific directory

## Smart Prevention of Self-Indexing

The tool automatically prevents indexing its own output files:

- Automatically excludes the output file from the indexing process
- Detects previous extraction files with the same name
- Prompts for confirmation before overwriting (unless `--force` is used)

This prevents recursive indexing problems and improves overall reliability.

## Example Output

The generated file will have this structure:

```
Total Tokens: 12345

Note: Only selected files are included with content. Inclusion patterns: main.py, utils/helpers.py

Directory Structure:

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helpers.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ models
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_main.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

All Files (Structure Only):

- src/main.py
- src/utils/helpers.py
- src/utils/config.py
- src/models/user.py
- tests/test_main.py
- README.md

Files With Content Included:

- src/main.py
- src/utils/helpers.py

================================================================================
src/main.py
================================================================================
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Main application entry point
"""
...
```

## Default Exclusions

By default, the tool excludes common binary files and system directories:

- Binary files: `.pyc`, `.exe`, `.dll`, `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.
- System directories: `.git`, `.svn`, `__pycache__`, `node_modules`, etc.

You can disable these defaults with the `--no-defaults` flag.

## Windows Users

When using exclusion patterns on Windows, remember to use forward slashes `/` instead of backslashes `\`:

```bash
python codebase_extractor.py --exclude "temp/" --exclude "logs/"
```

## Performance

The tool is optimized to handle large codebases efficiently:

- Files larger than 10MB are skipped by default (to avoid memory issues)
- Binary files are detected and excluded from content extraction
- Multiple encoding formats are supported (UTF-8, Latin-1, etc.)

## Use Cases

- **Code Reviews**: Generate a single file with all relevant code for review
- **Documentation**: Include code snippets in technical documentation
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand project structure
- **Archiving**: Create text-based snapshots of your codebase
- **AI Tools**: Prepare your codebase for analysis by AI tools or LLMs
  - **Token Optimization**: Include only specific files' content to reduce token usage with LLMs
  - **Context Preservation**: Keep the full directory structure for better context awareness

## Limitations

- Basic token counting (splits on whitespace)
- May have issues with very large files
- Binary files are detected but not included in the output
